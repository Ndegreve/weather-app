# Commit Skill

**Purpose:** Create properly formatted git commits with consistent style.

---

## When to Use

- User explicitly asks to commit
- After completing a feature or fix
- When work reaches a logical checkpoint

## Blocking Gates

1. Must have changes to commit (staged or unstaged)
2. Must not have merge conflicts
3. Tests should pass (if test suite exists)

## Steps

1. **Check Status**
   - Run `git status` to see all changes
   - Run `git diff` to review unstaged changes
   - Run `git diff --staged` to review staged changes

2. **Review Recent Style**
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commit messages
   - Match the project's commit message style

3. **Stage Changes**
   - Stage relevant files with `git add`
   - Do NOT stage files that contain secrets

4. **Generate Message**
   - Use conventional commits format: `type: subject`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
   - Include body explaining what and why
   - Add Co-Authored-By footer

5. **Create Commit**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'COMMIT_EOF'
   type: Short description

   - Detailed point 1
   - Detailed point 2

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   COMMIT_EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **Verify**
   - Run `git status` to confirm commit succeeded
   - Run `git log -1` to review the commit

## Safety Rules

- NEVER commit files containing secrets
- NEVER use --force or --no-verify
- NEVER amend pushed commits without explicit permission
- ALWAYS use HEREDOC for multi-line messages
