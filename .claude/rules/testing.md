# Testing Standards

<!-- Customize these standards for your test framework -->

- Every new feature or bug fix requires tests
- Test both success and failure paths
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, filesystems)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Aim for >80% code coverage on new code
- Keep test files mirroring the source directory structure
